                Hello, my  name is Carol Tsai. I was born and raised in Mission  Viejo, California but I moved to Philadelphia
                in the summer of 2021. I studied Environmental
                Sciences at UC Berkeley and graduated in 2020 with a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). After that I worked as a GIS contractor for
                Apple Maps for over a year.

                  I was first introduced to coding through some computer science classes I took in college. Although I
                  initially only took these classes to learn a new skill on the side, it quickly became a new mindset that I
                  gained for how to approach problems and find solutions. In my early career I began using some of my python
                  knowledge to write simple automation scipts for my team. I saw that coding could have so many more applications
                  and I wanted to learn more, so I decided to become a web developper. Here I would like to present some projects that I have worked 
                  since the start of my new journey.
